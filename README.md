# UG MAP
This is a terminal based app written in Java to desmonstrate the application of Dijkstra and A* algorithms in finding the best route in a graph. 

- First all the vantage places and their relative distances on the campus are modelled in a graph.
- The graph is representred in the program using adjancency list.
- The distances among the various places were precomputed using Google Map API.
- Dijstrak's algorithm was used to find the best route based on distances.
- A* algorithm was used to find the best route based on time.
